The scripts directory of the `eno` bot. Most current scripts are `bash`, one is `Python3`.
But these could be any scripts or programs in any language from `JavaScript` to `Go`.

If you want to separate certain private variables (e.g. password hashes) from the scripts for security reasons, then have a look at the file `config.rc.example`. This is an optional file used (if available) by some scripts.
